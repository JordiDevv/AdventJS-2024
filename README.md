# JavaScript Challenges - **AdventJS 2024** üß†üíª

This repository contains my progress on the **AdventJS 2024** challenges, a series of tasks designed to test and improve skills in **JavaScript**. When I started this challenge, I had very basic knowledge of the language, but this journey has allowed me to gain more solid and practical knowledge.

## üöÄ Progress and Learnings

As I worked through the exercises, I noticed an evolution in how I approached problems. Here are some of the key highlights of my learning:

- I discovered and worked with **complex data types** like `Set` and `Map`, learning how to use them effectively.
- I learned about various **built-in JavaScript methods** that proved useful for solving the challenges.
- I refined my approach to structuring and writing code, adapting to the language‚Äôs characteristics and paradigms.

Each challenge includes explanatory comments about its purpose and solution, which can be helpful for those who want to understand my approach or learn alongside me.

## üìÇ Repository Structure and Project Status

The repository is organized as follows:

- Each file corresponds to **each one of the days of AdventJS 2024**.
- Inside the files, you'll find:
  - **Problem description**: A brief explanation of what the challenge is about.
  - **Solution**: My approach to solving the problem, with comments in the code for better understanding.

This challenge is **incomplete** due to a lack of time. However, I managed to complete more than half of the tasks. During this time, I took full advantage of the practice and the opportunity to learn new techniques and methodologies in JavaScript.

## üìù Final Notes

Working on the **AdventJS 2024** challenges has been an excellent learning opportunity, and I hope this repository can also serve as a reference or inspiration for others. Thank you for visiting!
